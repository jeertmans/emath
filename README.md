# emath
emath is a multi-languages library of mathematics started by Jérome Eertmans.

The purpose of this library is to offer to users some new mathematics methods which are not always fully implemented in the specific language. I don't know all the libraries that exist but I made these methods to help me solving problems and I hope it will help you somehow too.
